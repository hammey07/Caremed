##CareMed – Final Year Project (2019)

Technology: Android (Java), XML, SQLite

Description:
CareMed is an Android application developed as my final year project in 2019, aimed at improving healthcare record management and patient engagement. The app supports two types of user logins — one for doctors and one for patients.

Doctor Portal: Doctors can create and manage digital health records, add prescriptions, and monitor multiple patients from their account.

Patient Portal: Patients can log in to view their health records, track prescribed medications, and monitor their progress over time.

Medication Tracking: Patients receive reminders and can easily follow their treatment plans.

Multi-User Support: A single doctor account can manage multiple patient profiles, ensuring scalability and real-world applicability.

Outcome:
The project highlighted my ability to design and develop role-based applications, implement data persistence with SQLite, and deliver a practical healthcare solution with user-friendly UI/UX.
